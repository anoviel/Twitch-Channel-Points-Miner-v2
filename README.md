# Twitch Channel Points Miner - v2

**Credits**
- Main idea: https://github.com/gottagofaster236/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner
- Bet system (Selenium): https://github.com/ClementRoyer/TwitchAutoCollect-AutoBet

> A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

> It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts), it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_), and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

Read more about channels point [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide)

## Main difference from the original repository:

- Improve the logging
- Final report with all the datas
- Rewrite the entire code using classe instead of module with global variables
- Automatic download the followers list and use as input
- Better 'Watch Streak' strategy in priority system [#11](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/11)
- Auto claim game drops from Twitch inventory [#21](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/21) Read more about game drops [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/mission-based-drops)
- Place the bet / make prediction and won or lose (good luck) your channel points! **(CURRENTLY IN BETA)**

For the bet system the script use Selenium. Could be usefull understand how to MakePrediction usign a [POST] request. I've also write a [poc](/TwitchChannelPointsMiner/classes/Twitch.py#L160) but I don't know how to calculate/create the transactionID. Any helps are welcome

## How to use:
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2`
2. Install all the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create your `run.py` file start from [example.py](/example.py)

    )
)

twitch_miner.mine(
    ["streamer1", "streamer2"],         # Array of streamers (order = priority)
    followers=False                     # Automatic download the list of your followers
)
```
You can also use all the default values except for your username obv. Short version:
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"])                   # Array of streamers OR
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True)                               # Automatic use the followers list OR
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"], followers=True)   # Mixed
```
4. Start mining! `python run.py`

### Limits
> Twitch has a limit - you can't watch more than 2 channels at one time. We take the first two streamers from the list as they have the highest priority.

Make sure to write the streamers array in order of priority from left to right. If you use `followers=True` Twitch return the streamers order by followed_at. So your last follow have the highest priority.

If the browser are currently betting or wait for more data It's impossible to interact with another event prediction from another streamer.

### Bet strategy

- **MOST_VOTED**: Select the option most voted based on users count
- **HIGH_ODDS**: Select the option with the highest odds
- **PERCENTAGE**: Select the option with the highest percentage based on odds (It's the same that show Twitch) - Should be the same of select LOWEST_ODDS
- **SMART**: If the majority in percent chose an option then follow the other users, otherwise choose the option with the highest odds

![Screenshot](./assets/prediction_screen.png)

Here a concrete example:

- **MOST_VOTED**: 21 Users have select **'over 7.5'**, instead of 9 'under 7.5'
- **HIGH_ODDS**: The highest odd is 2.27 on **'over 7.5'** vs 1.79 on 'under 7.5'
- **PERCENTAGE**: The highest percentage is 56% for **'under 7.5'**
- **SMART**: Calculate the percentage based on the users. The percentage are: 'over 7.5': 70% and 'under 7.5': 30%. If the difference between the two percatage are highter thant `percentage_gap` select the highest percentage, else the highest odds.
In this case if percentage_gap = 20 ; 70-30 = 40 > percentage_gap, so the bot will select 'over 7.5'

## Migrating from old repository (the original one):
If you already have a `twitch-cookies.pkl` and you don't want to login again please create a `cookies/` folder in the current directory and then copy the .pkl file with a new name `your-twitch-username.pkl`
```
.
+-- run.py
+-- cookies
|   +-- your-twitch-username.pkl
```

## Windows
Other users have find multiple problems on Windows my suggestion are:
 - Stop use Windows :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 - Suppress the emoji in logs with `logger_settings=LoggerSettings(emoji=False)`
 - Download the geckodriver from here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/ and extract in the same folder of this project. For other issue with geckodriver just googling: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path

Other usefully infos can be founded here: https://github.com/gottagofaster236/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner/issues/31

## Use Chrome instead Firefox
If you prefer Chrome instead Firefox please download the WebDriver matching with your Chrome version and OS from this link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
Extract the archivie, copy the chromedriver file in this project folder.
Edit your run.py file and the browser_settings should something like this:
```python
browser_settings=BrowserSettings(
    browser=Browser.CHROME,
    driver_path="/path/of/your/chromedriver"  # If no path was provided the script will try to search automatically
),
```

## Issue / Debug
When you open a new issue please use the correct template.
Please provide at least the following information/files:
- Browser (if you have the prediction feature enabled)
- Operation System
- Python Version
- logs/ `LoggerSettings(file_level=logging.DEBUG)`
- htmls/ `BrowserSettings(save_html=True)`
- screenshots/ `BrowserSettings(do_screenshot=True)`

Make sure also to have the latest commit.
